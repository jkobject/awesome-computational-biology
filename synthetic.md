## Software

- [Cello Cad](http://www.cellocad.org/): Genetic circuit design automation.
- [(Poly)merase](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/poly) - A Go library and command line utility for engineering organisms.
- [GENtle2](https://github.com/Synbiota/GENtle2): Web-Based DNA Editor for Synthetic Biology.
- [Gigabase](http://derk-jan.me/programming-life/): Brogramming for life.
- [fpSelection](http://fpselection.org/): fpSelection tool uses a set of algorithms for solving these problems efficiently to design n-color fluorophore panels that are optimized for maximal signal, minimal bleed-through, and other biological parameters for a specific fluorescent measurement instrument.

## Programming Languages

- [Verilog (Cello)](https://github.com/CIDARLAB/cello2): A genetic logic synthesis tool. A high-level logic specification written in Verilog (a hardware description language) can be synthesized to give a plasmid containing logic gates.
- [Eugene](http://eugenecad.org/): Eugene is a human- and machine-readable language for specifying the design of biological systems. It allows users to generate biological designs based on customizable constraints, such as the maximum number of included genetic parts, the directionality of specific components, or the total sequence length of the output device. [Specification](https://lab.eugenecad.org/documentation.html)

## Hardware

- [BioHackAcademy](https://github.com/biohackacademy): hardware design file repos from [Waag's BioHackAcadamy](http://biohackacademy.github.io/) online(?) course 
- [3DuF](https://3duf.org): Open souce design tool for microfluidics design.
